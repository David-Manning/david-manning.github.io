title: About me
---

My name is David Manning. 

I have a BSc in Mathematics and an MSc in Statistics, both from the University of Sheffield and I have eight years of working in analytics and data science teams at Amazon.
This blog is a place for me to put my thoughts on data, some code snips, and analyses. I am always open to chat to fellow data professionals, so feel free to message me on LinkedIn.
