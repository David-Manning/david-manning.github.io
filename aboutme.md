title: About me
---

My name is David Manning. 

I have a BSc in Mathematics and an MSc in Statistics, both from the University of Sheffield and I have eight years of working in analytics and data science teams at Amazon, plus a few years in human resources.
This blog is a place for me to put my thoughts on data, code snips, explanations, and analyses. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dl-manning/).

All views and work are my own.
